# Test Tooling as a service

QA should be about preventing defects(!bugs), Not finding them.

---
## Ideal Workflow
- For every new epic, SET determines if we have sufficient tooling to test the new feature.

- SET build/enhance existing automation tools and test frameworks as per need.

- Non-feature Dev utilizes these tools and framework to write feature tests (non-unit tests).

- SET reviews the test coverage, and sign off the release.

---
## Role of SET
- SETs should be quality advocates, influencing both development and operational processes.

- SET focus on how to improve our quality stack, and make it efficient.

    - Build and maintain tools to improve operational ease.

    - Tooling to support continuous integration/continuous deployment model.

    - Tools for contracts testing, resiliency testing, load testing and few more.

    - Tools to monitor service contracts SLAs.

---
## Benefits
- Strive quality ownership culture within team.

- Faster feedback cycle via automation.

- Feature knowledge is retained for more than 1 dev (test dev + feature dev).

- Gaining efficiency through specialization of SETs, building & using test tools.

- SETs becomes GoTo group for quality needs and solution.
